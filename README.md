# 🈴 🎒 DODMuniVR – Homepage of the Verona Course in Discrete Optimization and Decision Making

Welcome to the repository **DODMuniVR**, reference point for the Discrete Optimization and Decision Making (DODM) course at **University of Verona**. It is an optional course that aims to be an open space that can be attended regardless of the degree program as long as you are interested in problem solving and/or competitive programming.

### 🛠️ [tools](tools/)
Working tools Strumenti di lavoro e informazioni importanti per orientarsi nel corso:

- Link to the [DODM Telegram Group](https://t.me/DiscreteOptimization)
- [RTAL 💻 - our platform for the homework and for the project](tools/)
- [To know more about RTAL 💻 - A more advanced Guide](tools/IT_the-TALight-Problem-Solver-Tutorial1-internet-server.md💻)

It offers a history of lectures, topics and problems addressed, organized in:
- **[recaps of individual lectures](archive/lectures/)**
For each lesson, it offers an overview of what was covered, with objectives, ideas and main techniques, and proposals for possible problems/challenges to address to deepen the objective skills
- **[general collection by topics](archive/topics/)**
To start from an overview of the topics, techniques and skills of the course (each identified skill lists the problems and materials useful for its acquisition)
- **[general archive of problems](archive/problems/)** 
The problems encountered during the course this year, and many also from past years (each problem is also classified by topic or technique - the same problem can appear in multiple categories)

### 💍 [resources](resources/)  
  Our materials, handouts and videos but also links to external resources such as manuals, platforms with problems, videos and entire courses extremely valid to deepen the topics covered, and acquire further skills.
