INTRODUCTION:
Everybody help in organizing the course. Every meeting will be recorded. Half of the lectures will be held online.

CONTACTS:
The Telegram Group https://t.me/DiscreteOptimization allows to keep in touch in an all-2-all mode.
For communications of private interest:
    mail: romeo.rizzi@univr.it, roberto.zanotti@univr.it
Hint: For each message that could also be of interest to other comrades, please, scale up to the community dimension (that is, better to address it here within the Group). The course is yours and you can contribute to it. ;))
