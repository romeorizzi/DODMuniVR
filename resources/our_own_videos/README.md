# ðŸŽ¥ Our own videos on specific topics

You can book the creation of our videos that propose a problem or that then, incrementally, offer ideas or its solution or complete explanations or even how to conduct the coding.
In two senses: as an interested user, or by making yourself available to make videos yourself (in which case here is a useful project for exam purposes).
